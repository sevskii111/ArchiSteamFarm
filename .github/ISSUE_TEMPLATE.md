<!--
I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available under https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md and I believe that my issue is valid - it requires a response from ASF development team, and not ASF support.

I UNDERSTAND THAT IF MY ISSUE IS NOT MEETING CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES SPECIFIED ABOVE, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT IS NOT RELATED TO ASF DEVELOPMENT IN ANY WAY, THEN IT WILL BE CLOSED AND LEFT UNANSWERED.
