<!--
I fully read and understood contributing guidelines of ASF available under https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md and I believe that my issue is valid - it requires a response from ASF development team, and not ASF support.

I UNDERSTAND THAT IF MY ISSUE IS NOT MEETING CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES SPECIFIED ABOVE, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A QUESTION OR TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT IS NOT RELATED TO ASF DEVELOPMENT IN ANY WAY, THEN IT WILL BE CLOSED AND LEFT UNANSWERED.

Feel free to remove our notice and fill the template below with your details.

## Feature request

### Purpose

<!-- Purpose of the feature request - if it solves some problem, precise in particular what. If it benefits the program in some other way, precise in particular why. Present the underlying reason why this feature request makes sense, and what is the context of it. -->

### Solution

<!-- What would you like to see as a solution to the purpose specified by you above? What would work for you? -->

### Why currently available solutions are not sufficient?

<!-- If something you're suggesting is already possible, then explain to us why currently available solutions are not sufficient. If it's not possible yet, then explain to us why it should be. -->

### Does your suggestion fall into ASF scope?

<!-- Is ASF really the proper tool to include your enhancement in the first place? Is it connected with idling Steam cards? -->

### Is your suggestion abiding to Steam guidelines?

<!-- If not, it will not be considered. Please make sure that you're not suggesting anything potentially unwanted, botting Steam Market is just a single example of such thing - https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement / https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct -->

### Additional info

<!-- Everything else you consider worthy that we didn't ask for. -->
