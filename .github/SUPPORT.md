# Support

Our **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** is the official online documentation which covers at least a significant majority (if not all) of ASF subjects you could be interested in. We recommend to start with **[setting up](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Setting-up)**, **[configuration](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration)** and our **[FAQ](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/FAQ)** which should help you with setting up ASF, configuring it, as well as answering the most common questions that you might have. For more advanced matters, as well as further elaboration, we have other pages available on our **[wiki](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki)** that you can visit.

We also have two support channels dedicated to our ASF users, in case you couldn't manage to solve the issue yourself. We answer all support and technical matters on our **[Steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/discussions/1)**, which should be used for majority of the issues and questions, especially advanced ones. In addition to that, we have a **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/hSQgt8j)**, also known as "ASF chat", which is a good choice for more casual, simple questions. You're free to use the support channel that matches your preferences, although keep in mind that you have a higher chance solving your issue on the Steam group, where we're doing our best to answer all questions that couldn't be answered by our community itself (as opposed to ASF chat where we're not active 24/7 and therefore we're not able to help everybody).

GitHub **[issues](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/issues)** page is being used for ASF development, especially in regards to bugs and enhancements. We have a very strict policy regarding that, as GitHub is **not** a general support channel, it's dedicated exclusively to ASF development and we're not answering common ASF matters there, as we have appropriate support channels (mentioned above) for that. Common matters include not only general questions or issues that are obviously related to program usage, but also users reporting "bugs" that are clearly considered intended behaviour coming for example (and mainly) from misconfiguration or lack of understanding how the program works. If you're not sure whether your matter relates to ASF development or not, especially if you're not sure if it's a bug or intended behaviour coming from misconfiguration or lack of understanding how the program works, we recommend to use a support channel instead, where we'll answer you and forward your matter to GitHub if deemed appropriate. Invalid GitHub issues will be closed immediately and won't be answered.
